## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Positioning with Flexbox was the main thing I learned in this exercise.
I had a bit of trouble with the margins for the two paragraphs below the QR image. I think this could be done a bit easier.

I am happy with my first try.
